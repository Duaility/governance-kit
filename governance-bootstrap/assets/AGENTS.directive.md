## Rules to follow

If you are an agent — or a human — working in this repo, **read [CONSTITUTION.md](CONSTITUTION.md) and follow it**. It defines the principles, guidelines, and invariants that every change in this repo must satisfy.

- The mechanical invariants are enforced by `tests/governance/run.sh` (run via the pre-commit hook locally and the [governance.yml](.github/workflows/governance.yml) workflow in CI).
- The principles and guidelines cannot be mechanically checked — you are expected to read them and apply judgment. A change that defies a principle without explanation will block the PR.

See the **Compliance** section of [CONSTITUTION.md](CONSTITUTION.md) for the full directive, including how to document approved deviations.
