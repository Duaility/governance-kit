# COSTS.md

Append-only ledger of token consumption for agent-authored commits. Rows are
keyed by `Cost-Key`, which is mirrored into the commit trailers so the ledger
survives squash merges that strip the original commit history.

**Do not** rewrite or reorder rows. This file is the durable system-of-record
that the `agent-token-accounting` governance rule validates.

The per-runtime commit wrapper appends a row before invoking `git commit`;
the `prepare-commit-msg` hook stamps the matching trailers. See
[governance-bootstrap/references/AGENT_TOKEN_ACCOUNTING.md](governance-bootstrap/references/AGENT_TOKEN_ACCOUNTING.md)
for wiring instructions.
